# ALX Project: 0x00 - GraphQL Setup

This repository contains my setup for the ALX GraphQL project.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:
- Set up a GraphQL client in JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Practice querying a GraphQL API.
- Learn how to fetch and display data using GraphQL queries.

## ðŸš€ GraphQL API
For this project, I will be using the **Rick and Morty GraphQL API**:

This free API allows us to query characters, locations, and episodes from the Rick and Morty universe.
